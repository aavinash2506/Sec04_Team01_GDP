WORK WITH THE PROJECT.

Level 1: Play with Acids <br>
Purpose: Familiarize players with the properties of acids.<br>
Gameplay: Players interact with virtual acidic substances (like lemon juice, vinegar, etc.) to observe their effects on materials or indicators.
Players may dip litmus paper or other pH indicators in different acids to see how they change color.
They may also be asked to arrange acids in order of strength or pH value.
Learning Outcome: Players learn the characteristics of acids, such as their sour taste, corrosive nature, and reaction with indicators (turning litmus red), as well as their pH (less than 7).<br>
Level 2: Play with Bases <br>
Purpose: Introduce the characteristics of bases (alkalis). <br>
Gameplay: Players experiment with basic substances (like baking soda, soap, or ammonia) to understand their effects.
Similar to level 1, they use pH indicators to see how bases turn litmus blue or produce specific reactions.
They might be asked to identify and classify weak and strong bases.
Learning Outcome: Players understand the properties of bases, such as their bitter taste, slippery feel, and ability to neutralize acids, along with pH values greater than 7. <br>
Level 3: Play with Both Acids and Bases <br>
Purpose: Show how acids and bases interact with each other. <br>
Gameplay: Players can mix acids and bases to see how they neutralize each other, forming water and salts.
Players observe how the pH changes when different amounts of acids and bases are combined.
They might also experiment with different strengths of acids and bases to see how the outcomes vary.
Learning Outcome: Players learn about the process of neutralization and how it results in neutral products (pH around 7). They understand how acids and bases can balance each other out. <br>
Level 4: Play with Reactants and Products <br>
Purpose: Explore the outcomes of acid-base reactions, focusing on the reactants and products formed. <br>
Gameplay: Players conduct virtual experiments where they combine acids and bases to form specific products, such as salts and water.
They must predict or identify the products based on given reactants (e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O).
Players may also balance chemical equations to understand the stoichiometry of acid-base reactions.
Learning Outcome: Players learn to predict and balance acid-base reactions, understand the concept of reactants turning into products, and explore how different salts are formed based on the acid and base used.
